On the left page, there is a chart titled \"Development of Women's Occupations.\" The chart uses bar graphs to represent the number of women in various occupations over time, with years ranging from 1890 to 1945. Each bar graph has a different color and represents a specific occupation such as \"Domestic Service,\" \"Clerical Work,\" or \"Professional.\" On the right page, there is another chart titled \"Development of Men's Occupations.\" This chart also uses bar graphs to represent the number of men in various occupations over time. The years on this chart are similar to those on the left, and each occupation has a corresponding color-coded bar graph. Both charts include pictorial symbols representing different occupations, such as a house for domestic service or a book for clerical work. The style of the image is informational, with a focus on presenting data in a visual format to compare the development of women's and men's occupations over time."
