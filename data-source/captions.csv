w0011-p0012-f00,"Above: a mixed arable and dairy farm growing cereal and vegetables for sale as well as for the maintenance of a small herd of cows. This farm uses no imported cattle food. Below: a specialist dairy farm on which the grass is managed scientifically and additional feeding stuff is imported. Compare the equipment, labour and sales."
w0011-p0013-f00,"Of the physical factors that condition British farming systems the most important are rainfall and temperature. The left-hand map shows the counties which had the highest concentrations of cattle and sheep in the 1930's, and the largest acreages both of the principal cereals and of temporary and permanent pastures. The dividing line between oats and the other cereals was determined by the summer temperature; rainfall determined the boundary between permanent and temporary grass. Pigs and poultry have been omitted as they were maintained almost entirely on imported feeding stuffs.
The right-hand map shows the way in which British agriculture is likely to develop during the next 25 years. The new varieties of grass produced by plant-breeders have made the old boundaries out-of-date. A general extension of grazing leys would make it possible to double the pre-war output of milk without importing more feeding stuffs. Pigs could also be largely maintained on home-grown food."
w0011-p0015-f01,"Coventry's boundaries have been enlarged four times since 1890, while the population has grown fivefold. The time has come when simply adding new administrative districts to the outside edges of the city is just not enough–re-organisation must start from the centre and be drastic in its methods."
w0011-p0020-f01,"Coventry depends for its prosperity on one group of industries, shown in red. There are only the workers shown in green to provide Coventry people with goods and services."
w0011-p0038-f01,"This chart shows how a Tootal product comes into being. The production manager is the key man, but every material must pass the testing department-two out of every three samples are rejected. Designs come partly from outside studios, all other stages shown here are within the Tootal organisation. Ties, handkerchiefs, dresses, dressing-gowns and piece goods are sent all over the world."
